### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ ðŸ˜Ž I'm Sika[Ce-kaa], an alum of Ada Developers Academy, a highly immersive coding school where women and gender-expansive adults learn how to be Software Engineers. âœ¨

ðŸ”­  At Amazon Prime Video, where I'm interned for six months , I worked on enhancing the usability of the platform at Amazon Prime Video,. My contributions include features like a customizable column display,
 order alteration, preset filters/preferences saving, and a Quick Copy feature, which has improved efficiency and reduced errors.

ðŸŒ±  I'm currently learning advanced coding techniques in both React and Java in AWS environments as a Full-Stack to develop and implement applications like as mentioned above. 
   I'm using testing frameworks like Jest for React and JUnit for Java to ensure the robustness and reliability of applications.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects particularly centered around AI and machine learning, and passionate about leveraging these technologies for user-centered applications.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deepening my understanding of data science and machine learning concepts. I'm particularly interested in practical applications and real-world use cases.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience in bridging the gap between customer service and software development, and how I use this unique perspective to build better, more intuitive user experiences

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on my  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sika-sarpong)

âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from my love for coding, I'm an avid hiker and have a goal to explore every national park in the United States.
